BACKEND:
This project employs Python (Anaconda) and the GeoPandas and Folium mapping libraries.
I sourced data from the USDA Dataset website, then parsed, processed, and rendered the data onto interactive Folium maps using the Chloropleth function.
These folium maps were saved off as an HTML page.

FRONT END:
I then employed a Bootstrap framework called Carousel and specifically edited it to my custom needs.
index.html: 
	- landing page that all other pages branch off of
	- contains the carousel design and links to
		- Brook Trout info
		- Bull Trout info
		- Cutthroat Trout Info
Author.html
	- information about me
	- how to follow FLyAway on Github
USDA Datasets Link:
	- Links to website where datasets are available

Brook Trout Invasion:
	- Links to brookTrout.html
	- Page contains information about Brook Trout

Bull Trout Populations:
	- Links to bullTrout.html
	- Contains interactive folium map with population data

Cutthroat Trout Populations:
	- Links to cutTrout.html
	- Contains interactive folium map with population data

Overall, I'm happy with how this project turned out. GeoPandas and Folium gave me 
a bit of trouble but I believe it was more to do with the available datasets than
limitations of the library.The page takes a bit longer to load than I would like 
but this is due to the size of the HTML pages produced by Folium and the high resolution
of the images used.
